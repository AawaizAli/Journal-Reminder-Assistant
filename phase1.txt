Phase 1: Understanding & Building the Foundations for the Urdu+English Voice-Based Journal & Reminder Assistant
Study Material for Phase 1

This phase will focus on grasping the fundamentals required to implement the journal and reminder assistant. It includes voice processing, natural language understanding (NLU), date/time extraction, and basic reminder functionalities. The following topics will be covered:

1. Speech Recognition (Voice Input)
Study Material:

Overview of Speech Recognition:
Understand how speech recognition systems convert spoken language into text. Look into how various systems process voice signals and identify the words spoken.
Key Concepts:
Acoustic Model, Language Model, and Decoder.
Signal Processing in Speech Recognition.
Common Libraries: SpeechRecognition (Python) and Google Speech-to-Text API.
Resources:

SpeechRecognition Documentation
Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API
Tutorial: Speech Recognition in Python
Implementation Guide:

Install the SpeechRecognition library in Python:
pip install SpeechRecognition
Implement basic speech-to-text conversion using a microphone:
import speech_recognition as sr

# Initialize recognizer
recognizer = sr.Recognizer()

with sr.Microphone() as source:
    print("Listening...")
    audio = recognizer.listen(source)
    print("Recognizing...")

    try:
        text = recognizer.recognize_google(audio, language="en-GB")
        print("You said: ", text)
    except sr.UnknownValueError:
        print("Sorry, I could not understand.")
    except sr.RequestError:
        print("Sorry, my speech service is down.")
2. Natural Language Processing (NLP) with Urdu and English
Study Material:

Basics of NLP:
NLP is key for understanding and processing user input. In this case, you need to handle mixed-language input (Urdu + English).
Key Concepts: Tokenization, Named Entity Recognition (NER), Intent Recognition, and Sentiment Analysis.
Pre-trained Models: You can leverage models trained on mixed languages such as BERT, spaCy, or Hugging Face Transformers.
Resources:

spaCy NLP Documentation
Hugging Face Transformers
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
Implementation Guide:

Install spaCy and transformers:
pip install spacy transformers
Example: Language detection and basic sentence tokenization using spaCy.
import spacy
from spacy.lang.en import English
from spacy.lang.ur import Urdu

nlp_en = English()
nlp_ur = Urdu()

text = "How are you? آپ کیسے ہیں؟"

# English Tokenizer
doc_en = nlp_en(text)
print([token.text for token in doc_en])

# Urdu Tokenizer
doc_ur = nlp_ur(text)
print([token.text for token in doc_ur])
3. Date/Time Extraction and Parsing
Study Material:

Date Parsing in NLP:
Handling date and time extraction from user input is critical for reminders and journaling. This involves using libraries that can parse natural language dates (e.g., "tomorrow", "next week", "in 2 hours").
Libraries: parsedatetime, dateutil, and duckling.
Resources:

Parsedatetime Documentation
dateutil Documentation
duckling (Hugging Face)
Implementation Guide:

Use parsedatetime to interpret natural language dates and times:
pip install parsedatetime
import parsedatetime
import datetime

cal = parsedatetime.Calendar()
time_struct, parse_status = cal.parse("tomorrow at 6pm")
print("Parsed Date:", datetime.datetime(*time_struct[:6]))
4. Text-to-Speech (TTS) for Voice Output
Study Material:

Overview of TTS:
TTS systems convert text into speech. Key components are text analysis, prosody generation, and speech synthesis.
Popular Libraries: gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech), pyttsx3.
Resources:

gTTS Documentation
pyttsx3 Documentation
Implementation Guide:

Install gTTS:
pip install gTTS
Implement TTS to output reminders:
from gtts import gTTS
import os

text = "Reminder: Meeting at 3 PM"
tts = gTTS(text, lang='en')
tts.save("reminder.mp3")
os.system("start reminder.mp3")  # For Windows
5. Reminder System
Study Material:

Scheduling Reminders:
For the reminder feature, you'll need to set and schedule notifications. This involves parsing date and time, storing reminder data, and triggering voice-based reminders at the correct time.
Key Concepts: Cron Jobs, Task Scheduler, and Backend storage (SQLite/JSON).
Resources:

APScheduler Library
Task Scheduler in Python
Implementation Guide:

Use APScheduler to schedule reminders:
pip install apscheduler
from apscheduler.schedulers.background import BackgroundScheduler
import time

def reminder_job():
    print("Time to take your medicine!")
    # Add Text-to-Speech or other alert system here

scheduler = BackgroundScheduler()
scheduler.add_job(reminder_job, 'interval', minutes=1)
scheduler.start()

try:
    while True:
        time.sleep(1)
except (KeyboardInterrupt, SystemExit):
    scheduler.shutdown()
6. Implementing Emotion-Aware Summaries
Study Material:

Emotion Detection in Text:
Use sentiment analysis models to detect emotions in a journal entry and provide a summary or emotional tone.
Libraries: Hugging Face transformers, VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner).
Resources:

VADER Sentiment Analysis
Hugging Face Sentiment Models
Implementation Guide:

Use VADER for emotion analysis:
pip install vaderSentiment
from vaderSentiment.vaderSentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer

analyzer = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()
text = "I had a great day today!"
sentiment = analyzer.polarity_scores(text)
print(sentiment)
7. Handling Mixed-Language Input (Urdu+English)
Study Material:

Code-switching:
Code-switching is when speakers switch between languages within a conversation. Handling this in NLP requires models capable of dealing with mixed-language sentences.
Multilingual Models: BERT-based models (e.g., mBERT, XLM-R).
Resources:

Multilingual BERT Documentation
8. Integration of Everything (Voice Input, NLP, TTS, Scheduling)
After understanding the components above, integrate them into a full application:

Speech Recognition: Take input from the user.
NLP Processing: Identify intents, entities, and extract relevant information (date, time, mood).
Emotion-Aware Summaries: Analyze the user's mood based on input.
Reminder Scheduling: Store and schedule reminders using APScheduler.
Text-to-Speech (TTS): Notify the user via voice when a reminder is triggered.
Summary for Phase 1:
Complete study of speech recognition and NLP.
Learn how to handle date/time extraction and scheduling.
Implement basic speech-to-text and text-to-speech functionalities.
Implement basic reminder and journal entry systems.
Handle mixed-language inputs effectively.
By the end of this phase, you'll have the essential skills to build a working prototype of the journal and reminder assistant.
